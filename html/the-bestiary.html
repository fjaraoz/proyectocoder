                    <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" alt="Red-colored flying beast flapping its wings" src="../imgs/glaring-wyvern.gif">

                <div class="col-sm-9">
                    <p>This specimen of wyvern has a crimson coloration and spikes all over its body. Despite common sense, it appears that its front limbs are its legs and its back limbs are its wings. Thanks to this strange disposition it has a higher explosive speed than other wyverns.</p>
                        
                    <p>It makes nests atop high mountains and cliffs and occasionally shares it with grinning wyverns in order to intermix and take care of each other's offspring. It will from time to time descend upon the valleys and look for the sweetest fruit it can find,</p>
                        
                    <p>It uses all of its tricks in battle, it can sting with its tail spike to poison enemies, hit with a wing strike or use its talons to shoot thorns. It's a fierce opponent that can even rival true dragons due to its determination.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-9">
                    <p>This impostor has clear similarities to the cattle introduced by the new settlers, this makes one think it has acquired these adaptations recently and evolved from a similar vampire. Thanks to their mimicry, they camouflage amidst the cattle and forge a parasitic relationship with them.</p>
                    <p>They feed on the blood of the cattle and mate occasionally near their prey, giving birth to 2 or 3 cubs which will take advantage and feed on both the milk and then the blood of the cattle. Its tongue has adapted to this mechanism and its three prongs which are apt for severing arteries.</p> 
                    <p>Coincidentally their most dangerous trait is their lust for blood which will trigger when feeding. If attacked during feeding this species will go into a frenzy attacking relentlessly.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-9">
                    <p>The colossal Beast is bestowed with plates of chitin armor that can resist many blows. It has a wild temper and tends to go outside of its territory to chase intruders.</p>
                    <p>It has a pair of protruding horns that are always displayed and an additional two pairs that are pushed through its flesh when it's angered and retract when at ease. They are used to launch enemies and prey into the air for the reason of breaking its bones apart. Its best weapon however is its roar. With great force it deafens and stuns anyone in range.</p>
                    <p>Preferring the night, it makes its home inside crevices of cliffs, dense groves and the sort in order to shrug off sunlight. Despite its size and weight it will enter the sea to catch food if it gets desperate enough.</p>
